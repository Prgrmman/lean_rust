# Learn Rust

Hey, my name is Jonathan Terner, and I am interested in learning Rust, as I believe it offers clever alternatives for many pitfalls seen in classic systems programming languages.

I'm going to roughly organize this repo with a project per folder, and possibly some folders for libraries I make along the way.

I will update this file as I figure out what I am doing
